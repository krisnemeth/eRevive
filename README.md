HTML + SASS + PHP + MySQL

PHP project, connected to a MySQL database, built on a SASS and Bootstrap front end. 

Throughout this project I've learned how to develop functionality where Users can register, their account gets stored in the database with the password hashed. Then I moved on to developing the functionality that allows them to start uploading their products for sale, and manage their inventory through a CRUD system that includes image upload as well.
